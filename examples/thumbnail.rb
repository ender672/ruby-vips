# sample image shrinker for ruby-vips

# handy for leak checking, but not actually a complete shrinker. It takes no
# account of things like colour profiles, for example
#
# see vipsthumbnail, part of the standard vips distrubution, for a complete
# shrink program:
#
# https://github.com/jcupitt/libvips/blob/master/tools/vipsthumbnail.c
#
# this demo ought to be worked up to include all that stuff

# test with:
#
# $ for i in {1..100}; do cp ~/pics/wtc.jpg t_$i.jpg; done
# $ soak.rb t_*.jpg
#
# where wtc.jpg is a 10,000 x 10,000 pixel RGB image
#
# with ruby-vips 0.1.1 and vips-7.28.7 I see a steady ~50mb of memuse as this
# program runs (watching RES in top)
#
# on my laptop (2009 macbook running ubuntu 12.04):
#
# $ time ./soak.rb t_*.jpg
# real  0m47.809s
# user  0m33.626s
# sys   0m1.516s
#
# ie. about 0.5s real time to do a high-quality shrink of a 10k x 10k rgb jpg

# target size we shrink to ... the image will fit inside a size x size box
size = 128

# we apply a slight sharpen to thumbnails to make then "pop" a bit

# this chunk of ruby-vips should get better in the next version
#
# formats other than tif/png/jpg will be opened with the default loader -- 
# this will decompress small images to memory, large images via a temporary 
# disc file
