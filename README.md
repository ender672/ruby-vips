# ruby-vips : A fast image processing extension for Ruby.

*Note*: ruby-vips git master is the development version and uses features
from git master of libvips (the unreleased 7.29) as well. You may prefer
the stable 0.2 branch of ruby-vips.

ruby-vips is a ruby extension for [vips](http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk). 
It is extremely fast and it can process huge images without requiring the 
entire image to be loaded into memory. For example, the benchmark at 
[vips-benchmarks](https://github.com/stanislaw/vips-benchmarks) loads a large
image, crops, shrinks, sharpens and saves again:

website](http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk/index.php?title=Speed_and_Memory_Use).
There's a handy blog post explaining [how libvips opens
files](http://libvips.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/how-libvips-opens-file.html)
which gives some more background.

ruby-vips allows you to set up pipelines that don't get executed until you
output the image to disk or to a string. This means you can create,
manipulate, and pass around Image objects without incurring any memory or CPU
costs. The image is not actually processed until you write the image to memory
or to disk.

## Requirements.

  * OS X or Linux
  * MRI 1.8.7, 1.9.2
  * libvips 7.29 and later (it will work with earlier libvips, but some
    features may not be functional -- you may prefer the stable 0.1 branch)

## Installation.

### Ubuntu Prerequisites.

```bash
$ apt-get install libvips-dev
```

### OS X Prerequisites.

```bash
$ brew install vips -HEAD
```

TODO: Describe & test with macports.

### Other platforms

See [Installiation on various platforms](https://github.com/jcupitt/ruby-vips/wiki/installiation-on-various-platforms).

### Installing the gem.

```bash
$ gem install ruby-vips
```

or include it in Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ruby-vips'
```

## Documentation.

ruby-vips has [rdoc
documentation](http://rubydoc.info/gems/ruby-vips/0.1.1/frames). Also
see [Wiki page](https://github.com/jcupitt/ruby-vips/wiki)

## Small example

See also the
[examples](https://github.com/jcupitt/ruby-vips/tree/master/examples)
directory.

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'vips'

include VIPS

# Create an image object. It will not actually load the image until needed.
im = Image.jpeg('mypic.jpg')

# Shrink the jpeg by a factor of four when loading -- huge speed and CPU
# improvements on large images.
im = Image.jpeg('mypic.jpg', :shrink_factor => 4)

# Add a shrink by a factor of two to the pipeline. This will not actually be
# executed yet.
im_shrink_by_two = im.shrink(2)

# Write out the shrunk image to a PNG file. This is where the image is
# actually loaded and resized. With images that allow for random access from
# the hard drive (VIPS native format, tiled OpenEXR, ppm/pbm/pgm/pfm, tiled
# tiff, and RAW images), the entire image is never read into memory.
im_shrink_by_two.png('out.png', :interlace => true)

# All ruby-vips image commands can be chained, so the above sequence could
# be written as:
Image.jpeg('mypic.jpg', :shrink_factor => 4).shrink(2).png('out.png')

# The statement above will load the jpeg (pre-shrunk by a factor of four),
# shrink the image again by a factor of two, and then save as a png image.

# If you want to let vips determine file formats, you can use the generic
# reader and writer:
Image.new('mypic.jpg').shrink(2).write('out.png')
```

## Gotchas

### Contain memuse

ruby-vips only finalises vips images on GC. In other words:

```ruby
a = Image.new(filename)
a = nil
```

will not release the resources associated with a, you have to
either request a GC explicitly or wait for Ruby to GC for you. This can
be a problem if you're processing many images.

We suggest you schedule a GC every 100 images processed.

## Why use ruby-vips?

  - It supports over 250 low-level image and color manipulation operations.
  - Operations are chainable, and do not get executed until the image is sent to an output.
  - Memory use is low, even for very, very large images.
  - Fastest ruby library for resizing large images. See [benchmarks at the official libvips website](http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk/index.php?title=Speed_and_Memory_Use) and [vips-benchmarks](https://github.com/stanislaw/vips-benchmarks)
